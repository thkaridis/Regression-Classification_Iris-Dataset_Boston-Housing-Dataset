# Regression-Classification_Iris-Dataset_Boston-Housing-Dataset

Classification: The Iris dataset

Using this dataset, you are requested to apply the project template on the dataset. You are expected to provide (among other things) the following:

The dimensions of the dataset
A peek at the data -
Statistical summary of all attributes -
The class distribution (number of instances per class) -
Univariate plots to better understand each attribute -
Multivariate plots to better understand relationships between attributes -
Apply a set of algorithms and select the best model -
Split the dataset into training/test sets (with test set being the 20% of the dataset) and evaluate accuracy of the winning algorithm -
Report the confusion matrix

Regression: The Boston Housing Data dataset

Using this dataset, you are requested to apply the project template on the dataset. You are expected to provide (among other things) the following:
The dimensions of the dataset -
A peek at the data, Statistical summary of all attributes -
The class distribution (number of instances per class) -
Univariate plots to better understand each attribute(histograms,density plots, whisker plots) -
Multivariate plots to better understand relationships between attributes (scatter plot matrix
correlations) -
Evaluate algorithms also with normalisation/standardisation (along with the baseline) -
Improve results with tuning for the winning algorithm
