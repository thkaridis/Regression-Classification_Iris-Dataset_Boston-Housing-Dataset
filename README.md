# Regression-Classification_Iris-Dataset_Boston-Housing-Dataset

Classification: The Iris dataset

Using this dataset, you are requested to apply the project template on the dataset. You are expected to provide (among other things) the following:
• The dimensions of the dataset
• A peek at the data
• Statistical summary of all attributes
• The class distribution (number of instances per class)
• Univariate plots to better understand each attribute
• Multivariate plots to better understand relationships between attributes
• Apply a set of algorithms and select the best model
• Split the dataset into training/test sets (with test set being the 20% of the dataset) and evaluate
accuracy of the winning algorithm
• Report the confusion matrix

Regression: The Boston Housing Data dataset

Using this dataset, you are requested to apply the project template on the dataset. You are expected to provide (among other things) the following:
• The dimensions of the dataset
• A peek at the data
• Statistical summary of all attributes
• The class distribution (number of instances per class)
• Univariateplotstobetterunderstandeachattribute(histograms,densityplots,whiskerplots)
• Multivariate plots to better understand relationships between attributes (scatter plot matrix,
correlations)
• Do you have any ideas for feature engineering?
    Removethemostcorrelatedattributes?
    Normalising the dataset to reduce the effect of differing scales of attributes? 
    Standardising the dataset to reduce the effects of differing distributions?
• Evaluate algorithms also with normalisation/standardisation (along with the baseline)
• Improve results with tuning for the winning algorithm
